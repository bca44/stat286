# Sakila Project

This assignment was a fun one. I feel the report itself would have looked far better in a Tableau dashboard, but we hadn't covered that quite yet.

The assignment prompt:

You work for Sakila Movie Rentals. While your DVD rental business is now closed, you still have all the
data. As the data science team, you have been tasked by management with building a report of
information about your customer base. The result of this project is a polished report, with tables and
graphics as needed, made in a word processing tool of your choice like MS Word and submitted in pdf
format.

Access the Sakila database from the *company* server: statdb.byu.edu. You must be on campus,
connected to eduroam wifi to access the database. A schema for the Sakila database can be found here.
Generate the tables and graphs (if you choose to use tables and graphs) using any tool you wish. Give
your report a title and a description. Be sure that your report is easy to read and understand. At the end
of your report, provide the code used to generate the information used in your report.

Management specifically has concerns about numbers and trends related to unique customers, total
rentals from each country, top movie rentals, top movie genres, and top actors. They have also
considered the idea of special promotions for their top customers according to sales.

The requirements of this project are left intentionally open-ended, as you will likely be asked open
ended questions in your career. There may be times where your management knows what they want
information about but leaves the explicit details up to you.

When considering what to query and what information to include in your report, try to come up with
your own questions and answer them.

I chose to focus in on the top-performing; genres, movies, and countries.
